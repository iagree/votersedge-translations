# Voter's Edge Interface Translations

These is a sample of the the text strings in Voter's Edge, organized by page and language.

- A translator is given access to this repository & then can use Prose.io to edit the spanish translations, all files from the en are copied into the 'es' folder, and the content of the 'es' folder can be edited directly.

- In each file, there is a note to a url in QA that points to the page where this content can be viewed. We have tried to organize the text according to its position on the page, where appropriate.

- Strings that do not need translation are commented out (preceded by //)

- As new strings are added and in need of translation, they will be copied from en to es in english. The git log will show which strings are new, and we can share links to individual files that have new copy. If needed, we can add a flag before the copy that needs translation with the word "NEW and the date" 
// New January 23, 2016

- The files will then be given a technical proofing, comments and flags removed, and merged back in to the interface. The code will be pushed to QA and then the output can be viewed and revised.

- In all cases, the spanish language will be accessed by using the language toggle button at the top right of every screen.

- This translation is written in JSON format. Only the value (the text in the quotes) should be translated, not the key.

    key: "This is the value, and the value is what should be translated."
